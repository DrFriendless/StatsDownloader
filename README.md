# Extended Stats Downloader

My other project, ExtendedStats, consists of two components - the downloader and the web site.
These are independent pieces of code.
Both are written in Python, but I really don't like Python any more.
This is a rewrite of the downloader component in Kotlin.

## Main Feature

Downloads data and stores it in the stats database.

## Secondary Feature

Presents a web UI to see the health of the downloader and the latest progress.

## Secondary Feature

Presents a web UI to add / remove / refresh users in the database.
